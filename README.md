# TEC_impute
TEC imputation project code and data. We developed an algorithm called "Video Imputation with SoftImpute, Temporal Smoothing and Auxiliary Data" (VISTA) to impute video data such as the total electron content (TEC) map with missing values. Our method ensures both spatial and temporal smoothness.
